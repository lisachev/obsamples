# Lindy Effect
- The longer a non-perishable thing has been around, the longer it will be around. Like the spoon. Not like the human. 
- Things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like people, but "aging" in reverse.
- The older something valuable is, the more likely it will still be valuable in 100 years.

## Practical Usage
- *Let the cream rise to the top before you take a sip*: I use this when I let the cream of the TV series rise to the top, garnering end-of-year awards before choosing to watch them.

## Wiki
The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time.
