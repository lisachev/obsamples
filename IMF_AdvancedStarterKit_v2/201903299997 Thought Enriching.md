# Thought Enriching
*These are the basic foundations of thought and expression. There is still a lot of value in returning to the fundamentals.*

* Part 1, Thought Unpacking [[201906189997]], mostly covers thinking critically and analytically. 
* Part 2, Thought Enriching [[201903299997]], mostly covers thinking creatively and expressively.

This is about how to deconstruct (unpack) a Thought or Thing and then creatively reconstruct (enrich) it with masterful expression and impact. The mini-book title is currently: *Thinking & Expressing: The Unpacking & Enriching of a Thought or Thing for Clarity, Enrichment, Advantage, & Fulfillment*, with one of the stated goals being to replace stunted thoughts and boring expression.

## Ways to Enrich a Thought or Thing
(Is the title accurate, good? "Ways"? Currently it's really "Categories of Enriching" more than anything.)

After you have carved out the specifics of what that Thought or Thing is (possibly from using *Thought Unpacking*, you'll inevitably want to express it with impact, either precisely or creatively—and often both. The below are Thought Enriching Tools that will hopefully get you thinking in different planes, on higher levels, with words and thoughts that are not tired but full of life and character. (Don't forget the code-name “Metaphorica.”)

(Erasmus used a few of these words below to categorize his collection of thoughts. Remember the purpose is to be faster thinking—more deft, precise, inventive, and fun with what you are thinking and conveying.)
