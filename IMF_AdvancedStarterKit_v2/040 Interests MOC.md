# Interests 
Welcome to the Interests MOC. It can be quite a sprawling content map.

## Using the Dewey Decimal System
Despite some criticisms of the Dewey Decimal System, it's actually an excellent, pre-built, time-tested structure that works very well for structuring the interests of your digital library.

==NOTE: Most links are only starter pages for your various interests==

Note: There’s a reason this MOC is called interests and not Dewey. It isn’t about the whole decimal system; it’s about your interests. We’re just using Dewey’s basic outline as a fixed _spatial constellation_ upon which to easily add dots of new interests to it.
