# The IMF Framework
IMF stands for "**Index** and **Maps of Content**, and other fluid **Frameworks**". [^1]

## Why IMF?
Equipping your library with an Index, Maps, and other fluid Frameworks enhances your working experience. 

It is robust, flexible, and able to match your changing needs—which are undoubtably unique to you—both today and deep into your future.

## What is IMF
1. **The Index** - This can act as your homebase to ground you, and as a launching pad into your note library.
2. **Maps of Content** (MOCs) - These are like having curated worktables with all your relevant index cards placed on them. They are the mitochondria of a digital library. Once you use them, you'll be able to overcome the overwhelm that arises from having notes scattered everywhere. More on this later.
3. **Other Fluid Frameworks** [^2] -  Adding structure to your notes has gotten a bad rap lately. But if you know how to keep your structures fluid, you'll get the best of both worlds: order *and* chaos; excellent note retrieval *and* the serendipity of discovery. More on this later.

[^1]: Yes, that means it's the "Index Maps and Frameworks framework", which is accurate in describing the overall framework.
[^2]: The idea of structures or categories that help without limiting the user was given the name [[Fluid Taxonomies]], an excellent term coined by @mediapathic.
