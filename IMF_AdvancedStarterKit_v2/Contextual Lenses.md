# Contextual Lenses
An enjoyable and non-efficient way of thinking about a Thing, is to place several different lenses in front of it. Each offers a different view; some more valuable than others, all part of the process.

Contextual Lenses are similar to Mental Models and [[OODA Loop|OODA Looping]]. It stands apart because of the purpose:

- `Contextual Lenses` are primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding
- `Mental Models` are primarily for pattern recognition for efficient, optimal action.
