# Setting Up Your IMF Framework
### Basic steps
1. Go to the Index. Check it out. 
	- Notice the Front Matter links at the top. Those are handy.
	- Review the Main Categories
      - Do you see categories that relate to you?
    - Review the keywords below
2. Now starting clicking all the links. Get familiar with the pages. 
	- Do you notice how you can always quickly click back to the Index (or at least to a Content Map, and then to the Index)? That's powerful.
	- Do you see any patterns with how some of the Maps of Content (MOCs) are structured? Any you could imagine using?
4. What MOC is a subject you already have notes on? 
	- Start linking your own notes to that existing MOC. 
5. Customize that MOC to your heart's content.

That's the basic process.

Remember, the structure works for YOU, not the other way around (See [[Is IMF For You|Is an IMF-equipped library for me]]). You can always just create thousands of notes without looking at the Index once.

### Advanced steps
1. In the Index, start customizing the main categories to suit your personal needs. First read [[Setting up your Index Categories (IMF)]].
2. Play around, break things. Some categories you thought would work won't. That's fine, just rejigger things until they work better for you.
