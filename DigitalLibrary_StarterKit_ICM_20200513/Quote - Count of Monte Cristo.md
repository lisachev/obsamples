Dantes asks, "What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?‚Äù The wise Abbe replies, *"Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies.

From the collision of clouds electricity is produced; from electricity, lightning; from lightning, illumination."* 

*The Count of Monte Cristo*
