# ICM Glossary

### ICM Terms
-**The [[000 Index|Index]]** - This is where it all begins. It's the most root-level of all your notes. It's the most meta. Nothing outranks the Index. 
-**[[Categories of Personal Knowledge]]** - These are your 10 or so main categories of personal knowledge. Each category should have a link to a related Content Map.
- **[[Content Map|Content Maps]]** - A flexible contrast to a Table of Contents (TOC). A TOC has one linear, hierarchical structure. Conversly, the same info can be structured if completely different ways with Content Map. This is because they are [[Heterarchy|heterarchical]] by nature. 
- **ICM** - An acronym for "Index, Categories, and Maps", which represents the three main components of structuring this digital library.
- **MOC** - An acronym for "Map of Contents". See Content Maps. Instead of using the acronym "CM", I use "MOC" because it stands out visually and provides much better search results. 

### Other Terms
- **PKM** - "Personal Knowledge Management" - The process of individuals making, using, and organizing their personal notes.
