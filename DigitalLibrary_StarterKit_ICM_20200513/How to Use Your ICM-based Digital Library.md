# How to Use Your ICM-based Digital Library

### Basic steps
1. Go to the Index. Check it out. 
	- Notice the Front Matter links at the top. Those are handy.
	- Review the Categories
      - Do you see categories that relate to you?
    - Review the keywords below
2. Now starting clicking all the links. Get familiar with the pages. 
	- Do you notice how you can always quickly click back to the Index (or at least to a Content Map, and then to the Index)? That's powerful.
	- Do you see any patterns with how some of the Content Maps are structured? Any you could imagine using?
4. What concept map is a subject you already have notes on? 
	- Start linking your own notes to that existing content map. 
5. Customize that content map to your heart's content.

That's the basic process.

### Advanced steps
1. In the Index, start customizing the main categories to suit your personal needs. Read [[Commentary on My Choice of Categories]] first.
2. Play around, break things. Some categories you thought would work won't. That's fine, just rejigger things until they work better for you.

Remember, the structure works for YOU, not the other way around (See [[Is an ICM-based digital library for me]]. You can always just create thousands of notes without looking at the Index once. Don't let it get in your way of creating your stuff.
