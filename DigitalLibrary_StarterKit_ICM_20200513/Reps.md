# Reps
*"Reps, Reps, Reps."*  

In practicing a craft, just show up, and get reps: tiny reps, technical reps, reps from questions, reps by observation, reps by research, reps, reps, consistent, persistent reps! 

Learning, improving, deliberate practice…the underpinning of it all—the unspoken current flowing through any progression—is getting reps, in all forms, consistently and frequently.
