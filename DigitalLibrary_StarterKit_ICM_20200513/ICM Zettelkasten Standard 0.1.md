# ICM Zettelkasten Standard v20200513
The Goal of the ICM Zettelkasten Standard is to enhance the experience of working with your digital library. It is meant to be flexible and changed to meet your needs—which are undoubtably unique to you.

ICM stands for "**Index**, **Categories**, and content **Maps**". The three main components of an ICM-based digital library. 

There will be more vernacular. When it doubt, here's a [[ICM Glossary|glossary]]. 

## Features of an ICM-based Library
1. The root-level "**Index**" note
2. Your major **Categories** of Personal Knowledge (in the Index) 
3. The content **Maps** (positioned at the top of the sidebar when sorting A to Z)

A fourth notable feature is using links in the Front and Back Matter (e.g.: see the top and bottom of this note).

## Next Steps
**A)** You should read the [[Benefits of an ICM-based Digital Library]].

**B)** Or you can bypass that and read [[How to Use Your ICM-based Digital Library]]

**C)** Or you can just jump to the [[000 Index|Index]] and start playing around.
