# People MOC
Welcome to the People MOC. This is about having a place to honor the importance of the people in my life by jotting down notable information. 

==NOTE: These use the Date Time Unique ID's (DTIDs) in the form of YYYYMMDDHHmm. None of these will link to anything in this starter kit. I only chose not to delete them to provide an example of how they would look.==
