# Mind TOC
Welcome to the Mind TOC. First, let's define some overlapping meta-categories:

-   `Concepts` A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.
-   `Mental Models` are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms that—when applied to a current situation or thing—allow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.
-   `Metaphors` are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.
-   `Contextual Lenses` are primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating. 

### For Pattern Recognition
-   [[Concepts MOC Ex]]
-   [[Charlie Munger's Mental Models]]

### For Clarity, Problem-Solving, and Perspective
-   [[Levels of Magnification]] — Analyzing via three lenses.
-   Thought Unpacking — Thinking critically and analytically.
-   [[Contextual Lenses]] — Broadening perspective

### For Meditation and Imagination
-   Meditation Jaunts — A joyful sequence of various meditations to bounce between during a single 20-minute session. 
-   Mind Training — Imagination Practices #MindTraining
-   Mind Palaces — Mneumonic device

### For Creativity, Expression, and Enrichment
-   Thought Enriching — Thinking creatively and expressively.
-   Metaphor Making — List of worlds ripe for metaphors

## Other Unsorted Notes and Ideas
- *Mindfulness* is really just being present, ie observing and noticing things. People lump too much into it.
- Mind reference file — *Being Present, Active, and Engaged*
  - This is new. I'm adding this due to the modern-day importance of having Attentional Discipline, which is so so difficult with the infusion of attention robbers like phones and social media. I especially need to put focus here when I'm with other people.
