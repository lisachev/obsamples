# Benefits of an ICM-based Digital Library

### Reliable "Dashboard"
The three main features: **Index**, **Categories**, content **Maps** act as a homebase to re-ground one's thoughts. It’s consistent, comforting, satisfying, and not overly complex.

### Flexible "Dashboard"
No two digital libraries are alike. My "Quotes" category might be your "Habits" category. It's really the underlying structure that's valuable. 

### A Brain Launching Pad
The ICM Structure is filled with your personalized reminders of important categories of knowledge and their key terms. It helps jump starts the brain—reducing the activation energy needed to start thinking and connecting ideas.

### Enhanced Note Retrieval
Note retrieval becomes easier when you're staring at many possible jumping off points: categories, contexts, maps, and tags.

### Pre-built Framework
Your ≈10 [[Categories of Personal Knowledge]] structure your thinking within your digital library by providing a prebuilt latticework upon which to hang your new ideas. *It's your personalized Dewey Decimal System for your digital library.*

### Emphasizes Content Maps (MOCs)
[[Content Map|Content Maps]] (MOCs) are your key to adding structure to the chaos, especially as your digital library grows. Building content maps is how we consolidate and organize our knowledge. 

Content maps are excellent jumping off points into notes new and old. They are not hierarchical like a table of contents. They are [[Heterarchy|heterarchial]]. Meaning, you may have [[Example of Multiple Content Maps|multiple content maps, with the same links, organized differently]] to fit whatever persepective the note is for. 

### Improved Navigation
- The root "Index" note has a Front Matter filled with a bunch of prebuilt-hyperlinked MOCs to easily copy and modify for future notes:
	- ![[Index Front Matter]]
- With Content Maps (and some longer notes), I use Front Matter so it's easier to click around from note to note.
- With regular notes, I only use Back Matter since they are shorter notes. This places the content front and center, while still being easy to click on the links below.

### Future-Proofing for your Future Self
There are months that go by where I don't open my digital library. Before adopting plain text and adding structure, I would get anxiety when I would finally re-open it. However, I don't get that anxiety now because I have my trusty **Index**, **Categories**, and content **Maps**. In no time, I'm back up to speed and off to the races.

### Better Memory
Because of the structural elements the Index, Categories, and Maps provide my digital library, my recall has improved. This makes sense because of three important factors that the ICM Standard encourages:
1. [[Reps|Repetitions]] - I'm constantly returning to a home view and then re-launching into new directions in my digital library.
2. **Deep Contextual Thinking** - Making Content Maps forces you to really consider the unique qualities of the thought you're holding and how it relates to other thoughts. This type of deep, conceptual thinking strengthens neural connections—making [[Cobwebs into Cables|cobwebs into cables]].
3. [[Spatial Context]] - The numbered Content Maps, always at the top (when sorted A to Z), act as a spatial map. We remember things much better when we have a sort of "spatial constellation" of related things.

There are many benefits. But you may still be asking: [[Is an ICM-based digital library for me]]?
