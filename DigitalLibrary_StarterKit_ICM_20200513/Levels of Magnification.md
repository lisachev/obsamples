# Levels of Magnification
### Analyzing a Problem Through Three Different Levels of Magnification
I have found it useful to use three different levels of magnification when looking at some Thing and asking the question: 

*"What's the Problem?"*

* **Conceptual** — This is the high-level perspective, philosophical, theoretical, existential
* **Practical** — No fancy language, just the actual how-to of something
* **Technical** — The nuts and bolts, diving deep into the specifics of a thing

The most enjoyable and least efficient way of thinking about a Thing, is to place several different lenses in front of it. Each offers a different view; some more valuable than others, all part of the process.
