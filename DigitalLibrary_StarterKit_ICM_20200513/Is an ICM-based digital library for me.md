### Is an ICM-based digital library for me?
**If you're just starting out**
You don't need *any* of this. Just make notes and start writing. Worry about structure later.

**If you've got around 100-500 notes**
Some of your favorite notes will become harder to find. You'll start to desire a way to structure and organize your notes. Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you'll find yourself gravitating toward the creation of [[Content Map|Content Maps]].

**If you've got around 1000-4000 notes**
You'll want to structure your structures. This is where an ICM-based digital library starts providing mega-value. There are a lot of [[Benefits of an ICM-based Digital Library|benefits]].

**If you've got 4000-40,000 notes**
I've now entered the realm of speculation... Note retrieval becomes the biggest issue: can you find the thing you're looking for? I would say your only hope is fundamentally robust "organization and structure." Hopefully an ICM-based library can scale effectively at these numbers. You'll probably have content maps built upon other content maps. I would imagine the Index would still be your initial launching pad.
