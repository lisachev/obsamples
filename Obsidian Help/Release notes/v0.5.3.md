A quick release to fix a couple of things.  Released on 2020/05/15.


## Changes

- The is the big one: we changed all `Shift+Click` to `Ctrl/Cmd+Click` to open in new pane. Update your muscle memory now!
- There is now an "About" page in the Settings that will tell you what version you're on.

## No longer broken

- The Starred File plugin no longer halfway shows up when it's disabled.
- We remembered to put in the release notes this time!
