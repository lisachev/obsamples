
## Internal Links

Internal links are the backbone of your knowledge network.

To create an internal link, simply type `[[`. This will prompt you with the list of notes you can link too. Use `Up arrow` and `Down arrow` to navigate the suggestion list and `Enter` to select the current highlighted link.

You can also link to specific headers in files. Start typing a link like you would normally. When the note you want is highlighted, press `#` instead of `Enter` and you'll see a list of headings in that file. Continue typing or navigate with arrow keys as before, press `#`again at each subheading you want 
to add, and `Enter` to complete the link. 

## Tips
- To make the link display different text than its real note name in Preview, use the vertical pipe (shift+\) For example:  [[Another Page Title Here|Custom Link Name in Preview!]] 
	- To follow a link in the Preview pane, simply click on the link.
    - To follow a link in a new panel from Preview, click while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd`''
	- To follow a link in the Editor pane, click the link while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd`.
    - To follow a link in a new panel from the Editor, click the link while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd-Shift`''

- To see a preview of the linked content without leaving the current note, enable the [[page preview]] plugin and a popup window will be displayed.
