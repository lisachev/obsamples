# Quick Switcher
Introduced in [[v0.0.1]], **enabled** by default.

The Quick switcher lets you jump to other notes without leaving your keyboard. The shortcut to invoke it is `Ctrl/Cmd+O`. Just start typing, and matching filenames will be selected. Use up and down arrows to navigate the results, `Enter` to jump to a result, and  `Esc` to exit the quick switcher.

Before you enter anything, the top 5 most recently visited notes will be shown, so it's also useful to quickly switch two notes by doing `Ctrl/Cmd+O` → `Down arrow` → `Enter`.
