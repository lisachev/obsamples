# Custom CSS

Introduced in [[v0.3.0]], **disabled** by default.

When enabled, Obsidian will look for a file called `obsidian.css` in your vault root directory, and if it exists, applies it to the app itself.

You can open the developer tools by using `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I` to get information on the elements you want to customize.

Changes to `obsidian.css` will be detected automatically and reapplied. You do not need to restart the app.
